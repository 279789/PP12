# PP12: GUI Programming with X11 and GTK+

##  Goal

In this exercise you will:

1. Work directly with the X11 (Xlib) API to create a window and draw primitive graphics.
2. Install GTK+ and build a simple GTK3 application, then extend it with an additional feature.

**Important:** Start a stopwatch when you begin and work uninterruptedly for **90 minutes**. When time is up, stop immediately and record where you paused.

---

## Workflow

1. **Fork** this repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally.
3. Create a `solutions/` directory at the project root:

   ```bash
   mkdir solutions
   ```
4. Add each task’s source file(s) under `solutions/`.
5. **Commit** and **push** your solutions.
6. **Submit** your GitHub repo link for review.

---

## Prerequisites

* X11 development libraries (`libx11-dev`).
* GTK+ 3 development libraries (`libgtk-3-dev`).
* GNU C compiler (`gcc`).

## Tasks

### Task 1: Bare X11 Window & Drawing

**Objective:** Use Xlib directly to open a window and draw a rectangle.

1. Create `solutions/x11_draw.c` with the following skeleton:

   ```c
   #include <X11/Xlib.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main(void) {
       Display *dpy = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
       if (!dpy) {
           fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open display\n");
           return EXIT_FAILURE;
       }
       int screen = DefaultScreen(dpy);
       Window win = XCreateSimpleWindow(
           dpy, RootWindow(dpy, screen),
           10, 10, 400, 300, 1,
           BlackPixel(dpy, screen),
           WhitePixel(dpy, screen)
       );
       XSelectInput(dpy, win, ExposureMask | KeyPressMask);
       XMapWindow(dpy, win);

       GC gc = XCreateGC(dpy, win, 0, NULL);
       XSetForeground(dpy, gc, BlackPixel(dpy, screen));

       for(;;) {
           XEvent e;
           XNextEvent(dpy, &e);
           if (e.type == Expose) {
               // Draw a rectangle
               XDrawRectangle(dpy, win, gc, 50, 50, 200, 100);
           }
           if (e.type == KeyPress)
               break;
       }

       XFreeGC(dpy, gc);
       XDestroyWindow(dpy, win);
       XCloseDisplay(dpy);
       return EXIT_SUCCESS;
   }
   ```
2. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   gcc -o solutions/x11_draw solutions/x11_draw.c -lX11
   ./solutions/x11_draw
   ```

#### Reflection Questions

1. **What steps are required to open an X11 window and receive events?** *To open a Window with x11 few steps are nescessary. First we need to open a connection to the xserver. This is done by creating a Pointer of the type "Display" and Setting it to the worth of the function XOpenDisplay(NULL) NULL is no value, which stands for standard display. Or in other words, the pointer of dpy points at our Display. Next if section is that if the connction to our display somehow doesn't work that we get an Errormessage, and close our Programm. int screen gets the number of our default screen, which often is 0. In the next step we are actually creating our window called win withe Window type of the x11 librarie.
   XCreateSimpleWindow(
           dpy, RootWindow(dpy, screen),
           10, 10, 400, 300, 1,
           BlackPixel(dpy, screen),
           WhitePixel(dpy, screen)
   This function does create our window and it has many parameters. As you remember dpy is our Pointer to our display (where we want to opem our window. RootWindow(dpy, screen) Is the parent window of our default display (0), this also needed so that the window gets created at the right path. These numbers: 10, 10, 400, 300, 1, have a simple origin: x_pos,y_pos, X_length, y_length, frame_width. The next function does tell our Xserver which events are used  XSelectInput(dpy, win, ExposureMask | KeyPressMask); In our case we want to use the even ExposureMask(true if the window has to get "redrawn") and KeyPressmark(true if a Key is pressed) inside our window win on the default display dpy.  This function maps our Window (win) to the display: XMapWindow(dpy, win);.Final step is done with our endless for loop, it's usedto react immidiatly on our events. I guess that these are the steps nescessary to open a window and receive events.*

3. **How does the `Expose` event trigger your drawing code?** *The expose trigger is true, if our window has to get redrawn, for example sometimes if we move it in size or to another position (or in any case if we map it) our window has to get redrawn. Then our rectangle gets redrawn. This is nescessary, because if we redraw the window, we also want to have the rectangle on it.*

### Task 2: GTK+ 3 Application & Extension

**Objective:** Install GTK+ 3, build a basic GTK application, then add a new interactive feature.

1. Install GTK+ 3:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
   ```
2. Create `solutions/gtk_app.c` with this skeleton:

   ```c
   #include <gtk/gtk.h>

   static void on_button_clicked(GtkButton *button, gpointer user_data) {
       GtkLabel *label = GTK_LABEL(user_data);
       gtk_label_set_text(label, "Button clicked!");
   }

   int main(int argc, char **argv) {
       gtk_init(&argc, &argv);

       GtkWidget *window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
       gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "GTK+ Demo");
       gtk_window_set_default_size(GTK_WINDOW(window), 300, 200);
       g_signal_connect(window, "destroy", G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);

       GtkWidget *vbox = gtk_box_new(GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, 5);
       gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), vbox);

       GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new("Hello, GTK+!");
       gtk_box_pack_start(GTK_BOX(vbox), label, TRUE, TRUE, 0);

       GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_label("Click me");
       g_signal_connect(button, "clicked",
                        G_CALLBACK(on_button_clicked), label);
       gtk_box_pack_start(GTK_BOX(vbox), button, TRUE, TRUE, 0);

       gtk_widget_show_all(window);
       gtk_main();
       return 0;
   }
   ```
3. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   gcc -o solutions/gtk_app solutions/gtk_app.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0)
   ./solutions/gtk_app
   ```
4. **Extension Feature:** Modify the program to add a **text entry** (`GtkEntry`) above the button, and on button click update the label to show the entry’s current text instead of the fixed string.

   * Hint: use `gtk_entry_get_text()`.

#### Reflection Questions

1. **How does GTK’s signal-and-callback mechanism differ from X11’s event loop?** *In GTK we work with several functions that do the work for us. For example, if we want to know that our button is pressed, we use the function: g_signal_connect(button, "clicked", G_CALLBACK(on_button_clicked), textfield);, which does nothing else than calling our "on_button_clicked" function, which we than use to make the events happen that we want(after the button was pressed. X11s event loop is a very different concept first we have to define our XServer Input that we want to use, than we need to write a endless for loop, which is constantly observing inputchanges, if something changes we use an simple if condition do the wanted reaction*
2. **Why use `pkg-config` when compiling GTK applications?** *This is necessary so that our linker is able to find the libraries, because the gtk libraries are not on the default path. This also ensures that the right linker flags are set.*

**Remember:** Stop after **90 minutes** and record where you stopped.
